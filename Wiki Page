## Introduction
Welcome to the wiki page for the Virtual Reality Medical Image Visualization project! This wiki serves as a comprehensive 
guide to understanding the purpose, scope, and implementation of the code available in the associated GitHub repository. 
Whether you're a developer, researcher, or simply curious about virtual reality in healthcare, this wiki will provide valuable 
insights into the project.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to introduce the concept of virtual reality medical image visualization and demonstrate its 
potential applications in the field of healthcare. The code in the GitHub repository provides a simplified implementation that 
allows users to simulate the visualization of medical images using virtual reality technology.

## Project Overview
The Virtual Reality Medical Image Visualization project focuses on enhancing the visualization and planning process for epilepsy 
surgery. By optimizing the visualization of medical images, it aims to improve communication between neurophysiologists and 
neurosurgeons. The project leverages the power of virtual reality and provides an immersive and interactive experience for medical 
professionals.

The code available in the GitHub repository is a simplified version that aims to provide a basic understanding of the underlying
concepts and implementation. It allows users to explore a virtual environment and interact with 3D models of medical images, 
specifically brain structures used in epilepsy surgery planning.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Virtual Reality Medical Image Visualization project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have the required dependencies, such as Python and the necessary libraries, installed.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook file (`vSimple Virtual Reality Medical Image Visualization.ipynb`) in Jupyter notebook.
4. Run the file using the Python interpreter.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to simulate the virtual reality medical image visualization.

## Usage
The code in the GitHub repository provides a simplified implementation, making it accessible to individuals with low coding knowledge.
It serves as a starting point for understanding the concepts and exploring the possibilities of virtual reality medical image 
visualization. Users can interact with the virtual environment and manipulate 3D models of medical images using simple commands.
